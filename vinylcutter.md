#to bad health.

Toady i will be printing my name first by using **Inkscape** application and then will create the Vinyl sticker by using **Roland Vinyl Cutter**.
**Inkscape** under **File** section in the **Document Properties** first we have to set area as Custom size let's say **150 mm wide by 50 mm height**. Now select a bold font from the font menu and add text let's say my name as "**Samrat**" in Black&White only. Now save the file in **.svg** in the repository and export in png format with **600 dpi** for vinyl cutter.
