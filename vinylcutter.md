To start preparing a a vinyl sticker with **Roland Vinyl Cutter** we need to first create our design in **Inkscape**.

We have been given assignment of printing vinyl sticker of our own names. The size of the sticker should be **150 mm wide by 50 mm height**. In Inkscape under the _File_ section we have to navigate to _Document Properties_ we have to set area as custom with size as "_150 mm wide by 50 mm height_". Now we need to select a **Bold Font** from the font menu and add text let's say my name as "**Samrat**" in Black&White only.

Now save the file in **.svg** in the repository and export in png format with **600 dpi** for vinyl cutter.
